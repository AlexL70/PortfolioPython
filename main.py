    content = """Hello.

I am an experienced and creative software developer. Passion is solutionsâ€™ quality, particularly in terms of high performance, irredundant and easily maintainable code. I like learning and trying new programming languages and technologies from time to time. I am also quite well at choosing an optimal way of resolving non-trivial issues.

My primary speciality at the moment is web-app development with C# and .Net. I have a thorough understanding of RDBMS principles, vast experience in Oracle and MS/SQL programming, and a firm grip on Microsoft ASP.Net stuff. I have some front-end development skills as well but do not feel it like my dominant direction. I prefer developing the back-end (DB and business logic) part, though I do not mind doing some front-end development unless it is too sophisticated.

I developed software for different areas of activity, including banking, billing & CRM, contract management, content management, online trading and software development tools.
